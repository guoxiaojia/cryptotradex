                            CFDs are traded on margin, typically requiring just 10% to 20% of the asset value. This enables investors to participate in the market using a relatively small capital. Given the high market volatility of cryptocurrencies, CFDs represent a more efficient use of capital as compared to traditional exchange trading. For example:

                            <br><br>

                            Assuming Bitcoin (BTC) is currently priced at US$7,200.

                            * For example: Buying 1 BTC through CryptoTradexâ€™s BTC/USD CFD.

                            # For example: Buying 1 BTC on a traditional cryptocurrency exchange.<br>
                            Note: The above example does not include commission and fees.<br>

                            As seen from the example above, capital outlay required for a CFD is lower than traditional exchange trading, yet profits are the same. This allows CFDs to generate returns as high as 15 times.

                            Most cryptocurrency transactions require the updating of a blockchain, with a confirmation requiring at least 20 to 30 minutes (e.g. Bitcoin). On the contrary, cryptocurrency CFDs are executed almost instantly as they involve only the matching of prices between buyers and sellers on the CryptoTradex platform with no delivery of cryptocurrencies into cryptocurrency wallets. As such, investors have the opportunity to rapidly buy and sell, protecting themselves against unexpected market volatility.

                            There are two main ways of trading cryptocurrencies, online exchange trading and over-the-counter(OTC) trading. On online exchanges, trading cost consists of spread, commission, deposit fee, withdrawal fee and bank transaction fee amounting to about 5% of the transaction. For OTC trading, trading cost can even be higher. In some countries, heavy taxation can easily raise transaction cost to 15% - 20% of the transaction amount.

                            <br><br>

                            Next, Cryptocurrency CFDs help unify transactions onto a single platform, where many cryptocurrencies can be traded at low cost, also eliminating the need to manage separate wallets for different cryptocurrencies. For example, when trading 1 Bitcoin, large cryptocurrency CFD platforms only charge 1-2% in fees, which is cheaper than online exchange platforms. 

                            <br><br>

                            In conclusion, cryptocurrency CFDs can be traded with ease, require low capital outlay and have high potential returns. However, the benefit of a low capital outlay is weighed against a relatively higher risk due to market volatility; a situation with a negative balance may occur. Thus, cryptocurrency CFDs may not be for everyone.

                            <br><br>

                            <strong>Am I eligible to use cryptocurrency CFDs?</strong><br>
                            Before trading CFDs, it is important to understand its concept and risks involved. This includes understanding the rules of a cryptocurrency exchange and the fee structure, to avoid unnecessary losses. We believe that the following groups of individuals are most suited to trade cryptocurrency CFDs, enabling them to gain the largest potential returns.

                            <br><br>

                            <ol>

                        <li> 
                        <span> . 1) Experienced Forex trader</span>
                            <br>
                            The advantages of CFDs would be well understood and capitalized by experienced FX traders. For this group of investors, cryptocurrency CFD is a great trading instrument choice. Compared to traditional CFDs, the ultra-active cryptocurrency market makes cryptocurrency CFDs more volatile, allowing for quicker profits.

                            <br><br>

                            <li> 
                            <span> . 2) Holders of cryptocurrencies</span><br>
                            Investors who have cryptocurrencies in their portfolio would likely share the sentiment that cryptocurrencies will rise to become a key investment option in the financial world.
                            <br><br>

                            However, merely holding cryptocurrencies does not ensure that one can react quickly to large price movements, thus avoiding losses. Investors, who intend to hold cryptocurrencies as a long term investment, may consider setting aside 10% of the value of their cryptocurrency portfolio to trade cryptocurrency CFDs, generating quick returns in both bull and bear markets. This enables them to hedge their existing cryptocurrency portfolio risk.

                            <br><br>

                           <li>
                           <span> . 3) Experienced stock investor</span>
                           <br>
                            Experienced stock investors may utilize their existing knowledge, taking advantage of margin trading through CFDs, to hedge their portfolio risk. The biggest difference between a CFD and a stock is that a CFD allows investors to profit from both rising and falling prices, without having to pay for the full value of the asset, yet enjoy the same amount of potential gains and losses. Investors can make use of the short-selling mechanism of CFDs to hedge against market risk through portfolio diversification.

                            <br><br>

                            <li>
                            <span> . 4)Commodity futures/options trader</span><br>
                            Commodity futures and options are similar to CFDs in that they are all derivatives, which are useful for speculative trading. While price movement of commodity futures is determined by market demand and supply, information asymmetry gives commodity suppliers, and companies along the supply chain, the ability to predict future price movements more accurately than other participants in the market. This allows them to make consistent profits from the related futures and options contracts. On the other hand, the average investor who lacks insider information, is taking a gamble and relying on a stroke of luck to gain profits. 
                            <br><br>
                            In contrast, the cryptocurrency market is huge and information is largely disclosed, making it difficult to be controlled by market makers. Thus, it is suitable for speculators with large risk appetite to participate in.
